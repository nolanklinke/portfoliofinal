      My name is Nolan Klinke and I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I have
      experience in many different technologies, but consider myself proficient
      in the MERN stack. I enjoy building new applications and creating dynamic
      experiences through DOM manipulation and custom styling. I am a die-hard
      problem solver at heart and thoroughly enjoy the satisfaction of figuring
      out a complicated task or challenge. The things I enjoy most are spending
      time with my wife, Brianna, our pup, Wiggles, video games, and indulging
      in a donut or two.
