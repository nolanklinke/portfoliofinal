      My name is Nolan Klinke and I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I am
      comfortable working with many different technologies and really enjoy
      building new applications and creating dynamic experiences through DOM
      manipulation, database management, and custom styling. I am a die-hard
      problem solver at heart and find it thrilling being able to figure out a
      complicated task or challenge. The things I enjoy most are spending time
      with my wife, Brianna, our pup, Wiggles, video games, and indulging in a
      donut or two.
